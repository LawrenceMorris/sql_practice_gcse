sql_Practice_v2.py

This python program enables GCSE students to practice SQL commands on a sample database.The program is designed to complement the CAIE iGCSE syllabus.
Your computer needs to have python installed to run this program (which it probably does, if you have reached this point in the syllabus).

You should place the file sql_Practice_v2.py in a folder on your computer (do not leave it on downloads).

The first time you run the program, it will first create a separate database file. It will then allow you to run SQL commands on that database.

The very small database has the following structure:

ID     Title                              Last_Name       In_Stock    Cost
1      Narnia and the Wardrobe            Lewis           20          2.50
2      Frankenstein's Mirror              Franks          3           3.25
3      The Best of Michelangelo           Bonaventure     55          4.00
4      Italian Made Even Easier           Smith           7           3.69
5      Custer and Custard                 Jones           4           10.00
6      How to Tame a Toad                 Jackson         1           25.99
7      The Road More Traveled By          Pietro          0           5.25
