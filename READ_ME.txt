This python program enables GCSE students to practice SQL commands on a sample database.The program is designed to complement the CAIE iGCSE syllabus.
Your computer needs to have python installed to run this program (which it probably does, if you have reached this point in the syllabus).

This program does require you to install two python libraries (if  you haven't already) : duckdb and pandas

To do install these libraries:
1. Go to Command Prompt
2. type: pip install pandas
3. after that installs, type: pip install duckdb

Once those libraries are installed, sqlpractice.py should work!  Fingers crossed!
