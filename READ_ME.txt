This python program enables GCSE students to practice SQL commands on a sample database.The program is designed to complement the CAIE iGCSE syllabus.
Your computer needs to have python installed to run this program (which it probably does, if you have reached this point in the syllabus).

This program does require you to install two python libraries (if  you haven't already) : duckdb and pandas

To do install these libraries:
1. Go to Command Prompt
2. type: pip install pandas
3. after that installs, type: pip install duckdb

Once those libraries are installed, sqlpractice.py should work!  Fingers crossed!

The very small database has the following structure:

ID     Title                              Last_Name       In_Stock    Cost
1      Narnia and the Wardrobe            Lewis           20          2.50
2      Frankenstein's Mirror              Franks          3           3.25
3      The Best of Michelangelo           Bonaventure     55          4.00
4      Italian Made Even Easier           Smith           7           3.69
5      Custer and Custard                 Jones           4           10.00
6      How to Tame a Toad                 Jackson         1           25.99
7      The Road More Traveled By          Pietro          0           5.25
